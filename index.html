                <p>    
                    My name is Paxton Sharp and I was born in Junction City Kansas. My parents, Melissa and Perry raised me inside of a basketball household. My first word was mom, and my second was boo-ya, thanks to pops haha.               
                </p>
                <p>My favorite things to do are playhing video games and learning about anything that has to do with space, the oceans, technology, or the origin of the universe and how we got here. I personally believe in creation over evolution. One of my hobbies is also debating, which I did throughout highschool, and will debate anyone over any topic they please I just ask that I get 50% of the time.</p>
        <p> I take my family very seriously, they are the most important thing in my life. My mother, Melissa and my dog, Sophie are my closest family since the passing of my father in 2009. I'd go to the ends of the earth for them.   </p>
